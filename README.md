Data Visualization for RSVPs made in meetup community 
=====================================================

This is a simple application which displays RSVPs made for any event by members of meetup groups from all over the world. 

Meetup (https://www.meetup.com/) is a community where everyone posts their events and people who are interested can RSVP to those events and participate. Meetup API provide stream of data of RSVPs which are made by their members to all their events. I collect those RSVPs and using PubNub JavaScript API and Eon map framework for realtime data, I publish them as dropped pins in the world map.
